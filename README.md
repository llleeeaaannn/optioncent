## General Information
- Optioncent is a responsive web application built on the React framework with Javascript, HTML and CSS.
- Optioncent is a web-based word game. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word.
- Stockle relies on the Tradier API for its live option pricing data and custom calculations for determining the value of option contracts in relation to the value of their underlying assets.
- The purpose of Optioncent is to provide financial market participants, particularly retail traders, with an objective perspective on the value of the financial derivatives they are trading. Rather than displaying live prices in dollars, the call and put prices are provided as a percentage of the value of basket of underlying assets that they represent. This prevents users from being deceived by arbitrarily high (or low) values and to instead view the value of these derivatives as a derivative of the stocks or funds they represent.
- We hope that alongside delivering our users with the data necessary to view option prices in relation to their underlying, Optioncent also imparts a change in perspective to our users allowing them to more critically evaluate their investment decisions.
